\chapter{Conclusion}

We demonstrated the various modern methods on the Chinese corpus, and it indicated that PVDM and FastText are invariant to language property. 
In general, most models improve the semantic analysis compared with traditional TF-IDF, and it is more efficient to extract the information with more dense vectors.
Different models can be used in different context.

Most methods are developed based on properties of English or Latin languages, so segmentation or other preprocess work play crucial roles to make other language generalized.
But the segmentation may also contribute something wrong. Though some of them also can be conducted with non-segmented sentences, it performed worse due to improper segmentation.

We can see FastText demonstrate excellent property in both performance including training and testing time and memory utilization. 
Besides the accuracy of the semantic conversion, both the performance and the efficiency of memory also become the interest of study, since the information grows so quickly.
