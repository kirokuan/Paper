The data set we chose is WeiboScope, which is collected from 2012 WeiBo randomly. It contains 226 millions posts distributing over the year. We used the tags in post as the indicators of sentiment,and removed some duplicated posts and some posts without any tags, or too many tags and evaluate the accuracy of different algorithms.  We used the TF-IDF and SVM as baseline.
