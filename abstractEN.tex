The paper demonstrates how the deep learning methods published in recent years applied in Chinese dataset.

Recently, the deep learning techniques have attracted the great attention. Related areas also grow enormously. 
However, the most techniques use Indo-European languages mainly as evaluation objective, and developed corresponding to their properties.  
Besides Indo-European languages, there are Sino-Tibetan language and Altaic language, which also spoken widely. 
There are only some independant languages like Japanese or Korean, which have their own properties.
Chinese itself is belonged to Sino-Tibetan language family, and has some character like isolating language, tone, count word...etc.
Recently, many publications also use the multilingual dataset to evaluate their performance, but few of them discuss the differences among different languages. 

This study demonstrates the difference from traditional techniques with the preproccess like segmentation, and dive into the models for Chinese.
