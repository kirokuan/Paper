\section{前言}

Recently, Word2Vec converted the words to embedding , and the words can be operated as vectors. Additionally, the character is invariant to the language. Nevertheless, the problems in sentence level is more complicated, it's related to the sentence structure,  intention or context. There is several methods raised in recent years, like Siamese-CBOW, FastText ...etc. Most of them is able to train batch of text and construct the vectors. So far, most the studies are conducted in English, we are also interested if the feature also works in Chinese or other languages.
